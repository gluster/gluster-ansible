# On poolmetadatasize
# Internally, a thin pool contains a separate metadata device that is used to
# track the (dynamically) allocated regions of the thin LVs and snapshots. The
# poolmetadatasize option in the above command refers to the size of the pool
# meta data device.
# The maximum possible size for a metadata LV is 16 GiB. Gluster Storage
# recommends creating the metadata device of the maximum supported size. You can
# allocate less than the maximum if space is a concern, but in this case you
# should allocate a minimum of 0.5% of the pool size.
