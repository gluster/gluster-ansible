glusterfs-brick-create
=========

Given a set of physical devices, this role creates a volume group, a thin pool and thinly provisioned logical volume, creates an xfs filesystem and mounts the LV at a given path for use as a glusterfs brick. If an SSD device is provided, a lvmcache pool is created and attached to thin pool created.
Requires ```gdeploy``` to provide the modules used in the role.
